# 2023-ball-drive

Code for the experimental ball drive robot!

2 Motors will control each of the 4 spherical wheels, leading to a swerve drive-type control scheme.
Most of the code will probably be sourced from the previous season's mecanum bot, and will follow the same command style structure.

We may want to find a 3rd party swerve math library to import.
